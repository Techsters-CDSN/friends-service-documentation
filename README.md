# friends-service-documentation

This repository is part of Techsters-CDSN: an open-source application built to examine Microservice architectures from both technical and people perspectives.

This repository contains the documentation and OpenAPI definitions for the Friends service. This can be the basis of multiple implementations of this service.

Click [here](https://techsters-cdsn.github.io/friends-service-documentation/Friends-Service-Overview.md) for an overview of the Friends service.

This repository will be used to maintain the current API definitions for this service. The issue list will be used to report problems or request features with regard to the API itself, _not_ any particular implementation.

Implementations will be hosted in their own repositories.
